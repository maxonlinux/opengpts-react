### How to use:
1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Clone repo
3. ```cd``` to the cloned repo directory
4. Run ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies
5. Run ```npx pwa-assets-generator ./logo.svg``` to generate all the assets for PWA (e.g. Apple splash screens, etc.)
6. Run ```npm run dev``` to start in development mode, or
7. Run ```npm run build``` and then ```npm run preview``` to preview the app in production mode. To deploy it you will have to use some web server such as Nginx (or you can run it locally by just opening index.html in the browser)
